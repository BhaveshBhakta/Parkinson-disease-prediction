# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This repository showcases a machine learning-driven solution for predicting Parkinson's disease, combining multiple advanced algorithms with an interactive and dynamic web-based interface.  

## Project Overview  

Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Early detection is crucial for effective management. This project aims to assist in this process by using a predictive model powered by machine learning, coupled with a user-friendly web interface that makes the tool accessible to everyone.  

## Key Features  

### Machine Learning Models  
- **Algorithm Diversity**: The model leverages multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).  
- **Ensemble Learning**: A stacking classifier is employed to integrate predictions from these models, providing the most accurate and reliable output possible.  

### User Interaction  
- **Input Parameters**: The interface requires users to input medical parameters such as NHR, HNR, d2, and PPE, which are critical in diagnosing Parkinson's disease.  
- **Prediction Output**: Based on the input values, the tool predicts whether Parkinson's disease is present or not, helping users understand their health risks.  

### Web Design and User Experience  
- **Lenis for Mouse Trails**: Adds a visually appealing dynamic mouse trail effect for an engaging user interaction.  
- **GSAP Animations**: Implements smooth animations that elevate the overall look and feel of the website.  
- **ScrollTrigger for Dynamic Routing**: Enables seamless transitions between pages and sections, enhancing navigation and responsiveness.  

## Technical Highlights  
This project integrates cutting-edge machine learning techniques with modern web development practices:  
- **Data Analysis**: The algorithms are trained on comprehensive datasets, ensuring robustness and accuracy.  
- **Scalability**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future incorporation of additional features or models.  
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to various devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.  

## Purpose and Applications
